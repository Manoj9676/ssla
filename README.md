SSLA-based traffic sign and lane detection uses self-supervised learning to enhance autonomous driving. It pre-trains on unlabeled data, then fine-tunes for real-time detection using deep learning models like CNNs and Transformers. It improves robustness in diverse conditions, enabling accurate navigation.
